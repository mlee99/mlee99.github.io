## Who am I?

My name is Marcus, and I graduated from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA with my Bacehlors of Science in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Engineering Management. Currently, I've been working as a Project Engineering since December 2021 assisting with design work and order processing within the pump division for my company.

One of my main projects at my professional job is working with Microsoft Access, which is a database system, used in collaboration with our different departments (engineering, accounting, project management, and warranty) at our specific plant. We call this "OTIS" or "Order Task Intergration System." While I mearly adopted the platform, I was tasked to understand the programming and construction of the project inside and out. Form January 2022 and forward, I've mainted, updated, and created queries, tables, and forms using the intergrated tools, Visual Basic for Applications, and Jet SQL. While maintaining the platform, with any updates there are formal annoucements made to the affected departments similar to what is seen in Apple's App Store whenever an update is pushed.

I've thoroughly enjoyed the programming aspect of this project (a lot more so than my daily duties) due to the daily challenges I encounter, and the resultant outcome of a successful update. Ultimately, I'd like to make a transition from mechanical engineering into software development due to its work flexibility, problem solving from an individual standpoint, and the expansiveness of the industry.

Now, I'm looking to expand my programming knowledge with first web development and then move into back end programming focusing on data aggregation and presentation. 

### Projects

My projects will consist from multiple platforms including:
  - FreeCodeCamp.org
  - Frontend Mentor
  - The Odin Project

Others will be added as I produce more projects in the future. For now, a list is constructed below:

1. [QR Code Project](https://github.com/mlee99/qrCodeProject)
  - This is considered a "newbie" project focusing on pre-written HTML5 code, but emphasizes HTML construction/organization and also the knowledge of CSS. Sass, a CSS pre-processing langauge, was learned for the use of this project which also introduced variales, functions, and Sass construction. The challenge can be viewed at this website: [Frontend Mentor: QR code componenet](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H)
